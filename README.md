PyPokerSimulations
==================

Poker is a module intended to give you the ability to calculate hand equities against other hands, random hands, 
or even a range of hands. It, also, was written with the idea in mind of using it to create poker clients.

It's in its beginning stages, and there are some flaws that still need to be worked out. But, as it is now,
it's fairly decent at calculating hand equities.
